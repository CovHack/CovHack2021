Mol is CovHackSocâ€™s President, and is in her third year of studying Ethical Hacking. She enjoys social engineering and cryptography best of all, but is interested in anything nerdy. Mol hopes to bring in lots of guest speakers and enrichment this year, as well as executing an amazing CovHack! In her spare time, Mol plays Among Us and Fall Guys, as well as playing guitar.
