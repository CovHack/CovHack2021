David is this yearâ€™s Vice President and also on his 2nd year of studying Ethical Hacking. His job will consist of helping to manage the tasks of the President (Mol), whilst also checking up on the other committee members and helping out where he can. Last year, as a member, he had good communication with the committee, allowing him to get a good understanding of each role of the committee.  This year he will use this knowledge to be effective at his job.
